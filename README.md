# Zelle-Graphics-3D-Engine
Used Zelle Graphics (2D) to model 3D molecules
Added a zip file for all the files or just download the induvidual files you want.
Run simulation.py to try the program.
Molecules.py is the actual 3D stuff.
Don't expect too much from this, it only works on specific planes of rotation, but when it works, it looks cool.
All 3D molecules are 3D modeled in the molecule.txt file.
The zelle graphics (aka GraphicsPlus) file is also there.
